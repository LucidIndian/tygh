Indian Health Service, the Federal Health Program, notes _"The American Indian and Alaska Native people have long experienced lower health status when compared with other Americans."_ in the form of _"Lower life expectancy and the disproportionate disease burden."_ 

_"Given the higher health status enjoyed by most Americans, the lingering health disparities of American Indians and Alaska Natives are troubling."_
