"American Indian and Alaska Native adults are almost 3 times more likely to have type 2 diabetes compared to White adults." [^1]

>"In type 2 diabetes, your body does not use insulin properly...Over time, your pancreas can’t make enough insulin to 
> keep your blood glucose at normal levels. Type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older adults but 
> is increasing in young people." [^2]

November, both Native American Heritage Month and National Diabetes Awareness Month, invites us to reflect on the wisdom of our ancestors, about eating for health and life.

## The harvest is finished

Brothertown people everywhere remember the seasonal rhythm of the matrilineal harvest. Whether in New England, New York, or Wisconsin, each of these historic Brothertown lands express the same natural shift; the days shorten and darken, animals migrate or hibernate, and the first frosts are found resting on our homes and gardens; rendering them still.

Long before the modern idea of “preventive health,” the Brothertown Indian Nation (Eeyamquittoowauconnuck), an agricultural people, understood that food was more than sustenance, it was medicine, ceremony, and community. <!-- From the earliest days of our people’s journey, when families from the Mohegan, Pequot (western), Pequot (eastern), Niantic, Narragansett, Montaukett, and Tunxis tribes united to form the Brothertown Nation, food symbolized both survival and belonging. -->

## The Three Sisters: corn, beans, and squash

Among the most enduring symbols of Indigenous American agriculture and nutrition are the Three Sisters: sweet corn, pole beans, and squash. Each plant supports the other as they grow. Beans climb the corn’s stalk to get more sun, in turn, fixing nitrogen in the soil for the corn and adding protein to the diet. Squash spreads wide at the base, shading the ground to prevent competition from weeds, preserving moisture. [^3] 

The three sisters, along with wild rice, berries, and wild game were grown, gathered, and prepared in ways that provided complete nutrition and reflected the values of reciprocity and respect for the land. 

When I close my eyes and image a typical meal of these items on my plate: a steaming pile of green and purple beans, strips of deep orange and yellow squash boiled tender and warm, colorful corn on the cob roasted or even popped, a helping of hot, earth-toned rice besides a dark berry sauce, I see how "healthy" though how relatively "plain" it could appear: whole plants boiled or baked, few ingredients, no garnishes nor additives, organic, local, produced by my relatives. 

Besides being a hearty meal, the nutritional quality of the Three Sisters are complementary. Corn is a source of carbohydrates, protein and oils, but the protein is lacking in the amino acids, lysine and tryptophan. Beans provide the missing amino acids. Squash is a source of carbohydrates and more protein if the seeds are consumed. All three vegetables are high in fiber and together, provide a range of minerals and vitamins. [^4]

## Food as Wellness

Reviving traditional food practices isn’t merely about nostalgia, it’s about reclaiming health and defense against a preventable, diet-related disease. 

The causes are complex but the diabetes disparity Indigenous people face is likely rooted in how foods and lifestyles were altered through colonization, displacement from ancestral lands, loss of traditional food systems, exposure to processed and deficient foods, limited access to fresh produce, and economic barriers. 

Today, we know that a diet that is plant-based and low-carbohydrate has been linked with lower risk of premature death for people with type 2 diabetes. [] 

Community gardens, seed-saving programs, and traditional cooking workshops can become other key parts of this nutritional revival; but it seems like we must start eating differently, perhaps more indigenously, to reclaim of health. Simple steps, like cooking with whole vegetables or replacing refined sugars with berries, can reconnect us in small ways with ancestral practices while protecting us from harm.

## Call to Action

This month, try: 
- Cooking with corn, beans, and squash, the same foods that sustained our ancestors. 
- Prepare a pot of [Three Sisters stew](https://rollingharvest.org/2020/11/01/three-sisters-stew/#:~:text=Three%20Sisters'%20stew%20is%20a%20Native%20American,vary%20based%20on%20ingredients%20and%20products%20used.), or simply give thanks for the harvest. - Try a Brothertown [Wild Rice and Cranberries recipe](https://brothertownindians.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Recipe-Wild-Rice-and-Cranberries.pdf).
- Curious about your own health? Take a [Risk Test](https://diabetes.org/diabetes-risk-test) to find out if you are at increased risk for having type 2 diabetes. 

Each act of choosing traditional foods is an act of remembrance, resilience, and renewal of our health. This month, try returning in your own way to the food traditions of Eeyamquittoowauconnuck and at the same time, you are safeguarding your family against type 2 diabetes.

<!-- ## Thanksgiving Meal vs. Indigenous Three Sisters Meal

A standard American Thanksgiving meal could be between 2,500–3,500 kcal, is calorie-dense and fat-heavy, 300–350 g carbs, 60–70 g protein, 140–160 g fat, and could have 70–90 g added sugars. Main carbohydrate sources yield a medium-to-high glycemic index, promoting rapid blood sugar spikes:
- mashed potatoes (~80)
- bread stuffing (~70–75)
- pumpkin pie (~65)

In contrast, a traditional Indigenous meal of corn, beans, squash, wild rice, and berries is lower in calories (~850–950 kcal), plant-based and fiber-rich, providing around 150–170 g carbs, 35–45 g protein, 5–10 g fat, and 20–30 g natural sugars. 

Its lower glycemic index ensures slow, steady energy release: 
- beans (~30)
- wild rice (~45)
- squash (~50)
- berries (~25–40)
- corn (~55)

The standard American Thanksgiving plate is 3× higher in calories, 15–30× higher in fat, and loaded with refined carbs and added sugars while the Indigenous meal is lean, nutrient-dense, supporting health, and stable blood sugar.

Modern health trends should favor reviving Indigenous foods; studies show lower diabetes rates among Native communities consuming traditional diets. For balance, lighten the Thanksgiving plate (skinless turkey, less gravy) or enrich the Indigenous meal with lean protein. Either way, prioritizing whole foods and fiber over processed fats and sugars yields lasting benefits. -->
