November, both Native American Heritage Month and National Diabetes Awareness Month, invites us to reflect on the wisdom of our ancestors, about eating for health and life.
_Why do Indigenous people disproportionally suffer and die from diabetes?_

The causes are complex but this disparity is likely rooted in how foods and lifestyles were altered through colonization, displacement from ancestral lands, loss of traditional food systems, exposure to processed and deficient foods, limited access to fresh produce, and economic barriers. 

## The harvest is finished

Brothertown people everywhere remember the seasonal rhythm of the matrilineal harvest. Whether in New England, New York, or Wisconsin, each of these historic places express a similar natural shift; the days shorten and darken, animals migrate or hibernate, and the first frosts are found resting on our homes and gardens; rendering them still.

Long before the modern idea of “preventive health,” the Brothertown Indian Nation (Eeyamquittoowauconnuck), an agricultural people, understood that food was more than sustenance, it was ceremony, communit, and medicine. <!-- From the earliest days of our people’s journey, when families from the Mohegan, Pequot (western), Pequot (eastern), Niantic, Narragansett, Montaukett, and Tunxis tribes united to form the Brothertown Nation, food symbolized both survival and belonging. -->

## Three Sisters: corn, beans, and squash

Among the most enduring symbols of Indigenous American agriculture are the Three Sisters: corn, beans, and squash. Each plant supports the other as they grow. Beans climb the corn’s stalk to get more sun, in turn, fixing nitrogen in the soil for the corn and adding protein to the diet. Squash spreads wide at the base, shading the ground to prevent competition from weeds, preserving moisture. [^4] 

The three sisters, along with wild rice, berries, and wild game were grown, gathered, and prepared in ways that provided complete nutrition and reflected the values of reciprocity and respect for the land. 

## Indigenous food as wellness?

Today, we know a plant-based and low-carbohydrate diet has been linked with lower risk of premature death for people with type 2 diabetes[^5]. The three sisters seems like a perfect match! 

When I close my eyes and image a typical meal of these items on my plate: a steaming pile of green and purple beans, strips of deep orange and yellow squash boiled tender and warm, colorful corn on the cob roasted or even popped on hot coals, a pile of hot earth-toned wild rice beside a dark berry sauce, I can see and even smell how "healthy" though relatively "plain" it could appear: whole plants, few ingredients, no additives, organic, local, produced by my relatives. 

Besides being a hearty meal, the nutritional quality of the Three Sisters are complementary. Corn is a source of carbohydrates, protein and oils, but the protein is lacking in the amino acids, lysine and tryptophan. Beans provide the missing amino acids. Squash is a source of carbohydrates and more protein if the seeds are consumed. All three vegetables are high in fiber and together, provide a range of minerals and vitamins. [^6]

A compared to a typical American Thanksgiving meal, a hypothetical traditional meal of corn, beans, squash, wild rice, and berries is lower in calories, plant-based and fiber-rich.

Compared to other foods of the Standard American Diet, their relatively lower glycemic index of these foods the ensures slower, steady glucose and insulin response: 
- corn ~55 (Low/Medium)
- beans ~30 (Low)
- squash ~50 (Low)
- wild rice ~45 (Low)
- berries ~25–40 (Low)

Wild rice may take longer to cook but it has a lower glycemic index of ~45 (Low) compared to white rice at ~70 (high) [^7]

Reviving traditional food practices isn’t merely about nostalgia, it’s about reclaiming health and defense against a deadly and preventable diet-related disease.

Community gardens, seed-saving programs, and traditional cooking workshops can become other key parts of a nutritional-health revival. We must start eating differently, perhaps more indigenously, to reclaim our diabetes-free wellness we once had.

## Calls to Action for November

This month, try: 
- Cooking with corn, beans, and squash, the same foods that sustained our ancestors. 
- Prepare a pot of [Three Sisters stew](https://rollingharvest.org/2020/11/01/three-sisters-stew/#:~:text=Three%20Sisters'%20stew%20is%20a%20Native%20American,vary%20based%20on%20ingredients%20and%20products%20used.), or simply give thanks for the harvest. - Sharing a Brothertown [Wild Rice and Cranberries recipe](https://brothertownindians.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Recipe-Wild-Rice-and-Cranberries.pdf).
- Curious about your own health? Talk to your health care provider and take a [Risk Test](https://diabetes.org/diabetes-risk-test) to find out if you are at increased risk for having type 2 diabetes. 

Simple steps, like cooking with whole, non-starchy vegetables or replacing refined sugars with berries, can connect us in small ways with Indigenous dietary practices while protecting ourselves from harm.

Each act of choosing traditional foods is an act of remembrance, resilience, and renewal of our health. This month, try celebrating this indigenous food tradition. At the same time, you're safeguarding against type 2 diabetes.

<!-- ## Thanksgiving Meal vs. Indigenous Three Sisters Meal

A standard American Thanksgiving meal could be between 2,500–3,500 kcal, is calorie-dense and fat-heavy, 300–350 g carbs, 60–70 g protein, 140–160 g fat, and could have 70–90 g added sugars. Main carbohydrate sources yield a medium-to-high glycemic index, promoting rapid blood sugar spikes:
- mashed potatoes (~80)
- bread stuffing (~70–75)
- pumpkin pie (~65)

In contrast, a traditional Indigenous meal of corn, beans, squash, wild rice, and berries is lower in calories (~850–950 kcal), plant-based and fiber-rich, providing around 150–170 g carbs, 35–45 g protein, 5–10 g fat, and 20–30 g natural sugars. 

Its lower glycemic index ensures slow, steady energy release: 
- beans (~30)
- wild rice (~45)
- squash (~50)
- berries (~25–40)
- corn (~55)

The standard American Thanksgiving plate is 3× higher in calories, 15–30× higher in fat, and loaded with refined carbs and added sugars while the Indigenous meal is lean, nutrient-dense, supporting health, and stable blood sugar.

Modern health trends should favor reviving Indigenous foods; studies show lower diabetes rates among Native communities consuming traditional diets. For balance, lighten the Thanksgiving plate (skinless turkey, less gravy) or enrich the Indigenous meal with lean protein. Either way, prioritizing whole foods and fiber over processed fats and sugars yields lasting benefits. -->
