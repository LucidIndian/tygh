# Eating for Life: Traditional Brothertown Foodways and Diabetes Prevention

_For National Diabetes Awareness Month and Native American Heritage Month_

"American Indian and Alaska Native adults are almost 3 times more likely to have type 2 diabetes compared to White adults." [^1]

## The Harvest is Finishing

The days shorten and the first frosts settle over our Lakes. Brothertown people remember the rhythm of the matrilineal harvest—the time when food, family, and ceremony come together in gratitude. 

November, both Native American Heritage Month and National Diabetes Awareness Month, invites us to reflect not only on where our food comes from but on the wisdom our ancestors left us about eating for health and life.

## Food as Medicine

Long before the modern idea of “preventive health,” the Brothertown Indian Nation (Eeyamquittoowauconnuck) understood that food was more than sustenance—it was medicine, ceremony, and community. From the earliest days of our people’s journey—when families from the Mohegan, Pequot, Narragansett, Montauk, Niantic, and Tunxis tribes united to form the Brothertown Nation—food symbolized both survival and belonging.

Our traditional foods—the Three Sisters (corn, beans, and squash), along with wild rice, berries, and wild game—were grown, gathered, and prepared in ways that supported balance and health. These foods provided complete nutrition and reflected the values of reciprocity and respect for the land.

## What is type 2 Diabetes?

When our body does not use insulin properly to keep our blood glucose at a normal level. Type 2 diabetes is often preventable with a healthy diet and lifestyle.

## Understanding Diabetes in Indigenous Context

Today, diabetes disproportionately affects Native communities. The causes are complex, rooted in colonization, displacement from ancestral lands, and the loss of traditional food systems. Processed foods, limited access to fresh produce, and economic barriers have all contributed to this modern health crisis.

Alongside these challenges, many Indigenous nations—including the Brothertown Indian Nation—are reclaiming ancestral foodways as a pathway to prevention and healing. Reconnecting with traditional diets not only nourishes the body; it also restores identity, community, and spirit.

## The Wisdom of the Three Sisters

Among the most enduring symbols of Indigenous nutrition are the Three Sisters: corn, beans, and squash. 

Each plant supports the other as they grow. Beans climb the corn’s stalk, fixing nitrogen in the soil and adding protein to the diet. Squash spreads wide at the base, shading the ground and preserving moisture. This agricultural arrangement mirrors the values of interdependence and harmony that shape Brothertown life. Corn provides structure, growing tall and strong.

Together, they form a complete and balanced source of carbohydrates, fiber, and plant-based protein. Eating these foods regularly can help regulate blood sugar levels, support heart health, and provide sustained energy—all important factors in diabetes prevention.

## Wild Rice and Berries: The Superfoods of the Great Lakes

In Wisconsin and the surrounding region, wild rice (manoomin) and berries, especially blueberries, raspberries, and chokecherries, have long been part of the Brothertown seasonal diet. Berries, with their deep colors, are full of antioxidants that reduce inflammation and help the body process sugar more effectively. Wild rice is rich in complex carbohydrates, fiber, and essential minerals while remaining low to moderate on the glycemic index. 

There's an ongoing project to restore wild rice to Lake Winnebago, see [The Intertribal Lake Winnebago Wild Rice Revitalization Project](https://wildricerevitalization.wordpress.com/) to learn more.

These foods are not just nutritionally powerful—they are spiritual foods. They remind us of the lakes, forests, and wetlands that sustained our ancestors and continue to connect us to place and purpose.

<!-- ## Remembering November 26, 1839

On November 26, 1839, the Brothertown Indian Nation adopted its constitution, marking an enduring commitment to self-governance and community well-being. This date now stands as a moment of reflection and thanksgiving—a time to honor the resilience of our people and the teachings that sustain us.

As we approach this season of gathering and gratitude, remembering our ancestors’ relationship with the land can help guide how we care for our bodies today. Each meal prepared from traditional foods becomes a quiet act of sovereignty and survival. -->

## Reclaiming Our Foodways

Reviving traditional food practices isn’t about nostalgia—it’s about reclaiming health, identity, and connection. Community gardens, seed-saving programs, and traditional cooking workshops have become key parts of this revival within many Indigenous nations. Even simple steps—like choosing to cook with whole ingredients or replacing refined sugars with berries—can reconnect us with ancestral wellness.

For Brothertown citizens and our friends, incorporating traditional foods into daily life honors the generations who came before while building a healthier future for those yet to come.

## A Call to Action

This month, as you gather with loved ones, try cooking with corn, beans, and squash—the foods that sustained our ancestors. Prepare a pot of Three Sisters stew, roast squash with wild rice, or simply give thanks for the harvest. 

Try and share a Brothertown [Wild Rice and Cranberries recipe](https://brothertownindians.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Recipe-Wild-Rice-and-Cranberries.pdf).


Each act of choosing traditional foods is an act of remembrance, resilience, and renewal.

Try returning in your own way to the foodways of Eeyamquittoowauconnuck.
